*DESCRIPTION*: In the final task, we developed a recommendation system based on collaborative filtering techniques using the MovieLens 100K dataset. The goal was to recommend movies to users based on the preferences of similar users.
We started by loading and preprocessing the dataset, creating a user-item matrix representing user ratings for movies. We then calculated pairwise user similarities using cosine similarity to identify users with similar taste profiles.
Using these similarities, we implemented a function to generate personalized movie recommendations for any given user by aggregating highly rated movies from similar users, excluding movies already rated by the target user.
This approach demonstrated the power of collaborative filtering in capturing implicit user preferences and producing meaningful recommendations without needing explicit item features.
Overall, this task gave practical exposure to recommendation system fundamentals, similarity metrics, and handling sparse user-item data.
